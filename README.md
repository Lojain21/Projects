# üöó Used Cars Dataset Analysis ([View Project](https://github.com/Lojain21/Used-Cars-Analysis/blob/main/Used_cars_dataset_project.ipynb))

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of used cars from Craigslist to extract insights, clean data, and prepare it for exploratory and predictive analysis. The dataset was processed to remove inconsistencies, handle missing data, and standardize information, enabling meaningful exploration and analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Process  
1. **Column Selection:**  
   - Irrelevant columns such as `url`, `region_url`, `VIN`, `description`, and `image_url` were removed.  

2. **Handling Missing Values:**  
   - Columns with more than 50% missing values were dropped.  
   - For categorical columns, missing values were replaced with `'Unknown'`.  
   - For numerical columns, missing values were replaced with the median.  

3. **Outlier Removal:**  
   - Price values outside the range of \$500 to the 99th percentile were excluded.  
   - Odometer readings above the 99th percentile were filtered out.  

4. **Data Standardization:**  
   - Categorical fields like `condition`, `fuel`, `transmission`, `drive`, and `paint_color` were standardized to lowercase.  

5. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - New columns such as `vehicle_age` and `posting_year` were derived to enhance analysis capabilities.  

6. **Deduplication:**  
   - Duplicate records were removed to ensure data integrity.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Summary statistics were calculated to understand the distribution of features.  
- Key relationships between attributes like `price`, `year`, `odometer`, and `manufacturer` were explored.  
- Patterns in categorical features such as `fuel` type and `transmission` were visualized.

### üìà Insights  
1. **Price Distribution:**  
   - Majority of vehicles are priced between \$5,000 and \$15,000, with a small number of high-end vehicles exceeding \$50,000.  

2. **Vehicle Age:**  
   - Older vehicles (10+ years) are predominantly listed at lower prices, while newer models command a premium.  

3. **Fuel Type Trends:**  
   - Gasoline-powered vehicles dominate the dataset, followed by diesel. Electric and hybrid options make up a minimal portion of listings.  

4. **Odometer Impact:**  
   - Lower mileage vehicles are priced significantly higher than high-mileage counterparts, showcasing a clear inverse relationship.  

5. **Condition Influence:**  
   - Vehicles in "excellent" and "like new" condition are priced 20‚Äì40% higher compared to those in "fair" or "good" condition.  

6. **Regional Trends:**  
   - Urban regions tend to have higher vehicle prices due to demand, while rural areas list vehicles at more competitive prices.  

7. **Transmission Preference:**  
   - Automatic transmissions dominate listings, with manual transmission vehicles primarily in specific regions or niche markets.
